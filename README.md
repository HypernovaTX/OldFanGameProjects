# OldFanGameProjects
An open source collection of my old fan game projects.

* /GunGame - Hello Gun Game (Written in spring 2019) - A Mario platformer shooter game as a parody of a series of fan games created by a developer who purposely block constructive criticisms and lack of creativity
* /HelloClone - Typical Mario Game (Written between 2009 to Nov 2012) - Originally called Hello Clone since it is based off of the "Hello SMB1 Engine" (I would call it more of a framework). Since a lot of users make uncreative cookie cutter games with "Hello SMB1 Engine", I decided to use the same framework and build something rather fun, creative, and weird.
